# Population level impact of mass drug administration against schistosomiasis with novel anthelmintic drugs targeting juvenile schistosomes: a modelling study

## Summary
This repository contains analytic code to simulate a human population exposed to _Schistosoma mansoni_ parasites, including explicit representation of the juvenile parasites. It includes an individual-based mechanistic model of _S. mansoni_ infection and simulated mass drug administration control programs in three different epidemiologic environments. It can simulate control programs with praziquantel (single-dose and two-dose regimen) and hypothetical novel drugs with varying assumptions on efficacy against adult and juvenile parasites. Outputs include figures illustrating infection prevalence over time.

Parameters in these models were set using a grid search calibration process involving human judgement that cannot be exactly reproduced here. However, the repository includes code that can demonstrate the agreement of the simulations with [SCORE data](https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_d6a1141fbf/new/details#Contacts).

The study is currently in revision for publication.

This code was written using R version 4.4.1 and Python version 3.9.7.
